<h3>Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Robert</h3>
I am a psychology major interested in data analysis and virtual reality. I currently develop virtual reality simulations to test responses to natural disasters at California State University Channel Islands. Through some of my courses I learned that I also enjoy data analysis. I have experience using R, Mplus, and SPSS. If you want to learn more about me, you can do so at robertmceachron.com
